# SwerpBox

SwerpBox, a seedbox and Media Center combined with the power of  üê≥ Docker.  


## Get Started

Clone this repository or upload the contents of the repository to your web server. Where you place the SwerpBox files is where all of your activities will take place. I recommend working out of your home directory.

Example: `/home/<USER>/swerpbox`  

In the `config/nginx` directory, run the following command in order to password protect your ruTorrent installation.

`htpasswd -c htpasswd <USER>`

Enter a password to use. If you are unable to run the command, make sure you've got apache2-utils installed on your server.


### nginx



### rTorrent/ruTorrent
